=== Prerequisites

==== `docker`

You must have docker installed.

=== Output

==== Expected artifacts

[arabic]
. A container image of the shared cluster-api-provider-metal3 manager
. A git tag
. A release on Github containing:
* A manifest file - `infrastructure-components.yaml`
* A metadata file - `metadata.yaml`
* A cluster template - `cluster-template.yaml`
* A file containing an example of variables to set -
`example_variables.rc`

==== Artifact locations

[arabic]
. The container image is found in the registry `quay.io/metal3-io` with
an image name of `cluster-api-provider-metal3` and a tag that matches
the release version. The image is automatically built once the release
has been created.

=== Creating a release for CAPM3

==== Process

For version v0.x.y:

[arabic]
. Create the release notes `make release-notes`. Copy the output and
sort manually the items that need to be sorted.
. Create an annotated tag `git tag -a v0.x.y -m v0.x.y`. To use your GPG
signature when pushing the tag, use `git tag -s [...]` instead
. Push the tag to the GitHub repository `git push origin v0.x.y` NB:
`origin` should be the name of the remote pointing to
`github.com/metal3-io/cluster-api-provider-metal3`
. Run `make release` to build artifacts (the image is automatically
built by CI)
. https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/creating-releases[Create
a release in GitHub] that contains the elements listed above that have
been created in the `out` folder
. Create a branch `release-0.x` for a minor release for backports and
bug fixes.

==== Permissions

Releasing requires a particular set of permissions.

* Tag push access to the GitHub repository
* GitHub Release creation access

=== Impact on Metal3

Multiple additional actions are required in the Metal3 project

==== Update the Jenkins jobs

For each minor or major release, two jobs need to be created :

* a master job that runs on a regular basis
* a PR verification job that is triggered by a keyword on a PR targeted
for that release branch.

==== Update Metal3-dev-env

Metal3-dev-env variables need to be modified. After a major or minor
release, the new minor version (that follows CAPI versioning) should
point to master for CAPM3 and the released version should point to the
release branch.

==== Update the image of CAPM3 in the release branch

If you just created a release branch (i.e. minor version release), you
should modify the image for CAPM3 deployment in this branch to be tagged
with the branch name. The image will then follow the branch.
